# Instructions
# ðŸ’ª This exercise is HARD ðŸ’ª
# Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.
# You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.
# e.g. if file1.txt contained:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# and file2.txt contained:
# 2
# 3
# 4
# result = [2, 3]
# IMPORTANT: The output should be a list of integers and not strings! Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.
# Example Output
# [3, 6, 5, 33, 12, 7, 42, 13]
# Hint
# Use the keyword method for starting the List comprehension and fill in the relevant parts.
# First, you will need to read from the files and create a list using the lines in the files.
# This method will be really useful: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_file_readlines.asp
# Remember you can check if a value exists in a list using the in keyword. https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_in.asp
# Remember you can use the int() method in python to convert a string into an integer.

with open("file1.txt") as f1:
    list_1 = f1.readlines()

with open("file2.txt") as f2:
    list_2 = f2.readlines()

# print(list_1)
# list_1_strip = [i.strip('\n') for i in list_1]
# print(list_1_strip)

list_1_of_int = [int(i.strip('\n')) for i in list_1]
print(f"{list_1_of_int=}")
list_2_of_int = [int(i.strip('\n')) for i in list_2]
print(f"{list_2_of_int=}")

result = [i for i in list_1_of_int if i in list_2_of_int]
print(result)






# Write your code above ðŸ‘†
# print(result)
